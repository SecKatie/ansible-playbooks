# Kubernetes Role Split Summary

The original `k8s` role has been successfully split into four separate, more specific roles for better modularity and maintenance.

## New Roles Created

  - Main tasks for downloading and deploying dashboard
  - Templates for admin user and service configuration
  - Default variables for dashboard configuration

  - Configurable service type (NodePort/LoadBalancer)
  - Token extraction for dashboard access

### 2. `install_kubeseal`

## Original Role Status

The original `roles/k8s/` role has been updated to indicate it has been split and should no longer be used. The individual application-specific roles should be used instead.

## Benefits of This Split

1. **Modularity**: Each application can be installed independently
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and maintain individual applications
3. **Flexibility**: Can choose which applications to install without installing all
4. **Clarity**: Each role has a clear, single responsibility
5. **Documentation**: Each role has its own README with specific documentation

## Usage

Instead of using the monolithic `k8s` role, use the specific roles:

```yaml
- hosts: kubernetes-master
  roles:
    - install_k8s_dashboard
    - install_kubeseal
    - install_ghost
    - install_docmost
```

Or install only the applications you need:

```yaml
- hosts: kubernetes-master
  roles:
    - install_k8s_dashboard
    - install_kubeseal
```
