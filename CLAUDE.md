# Ansible Playbooks Documentation

For complete usage documentation, see @README.md

This file serves as a reference pointer to the main documentation to avoid duplication.
- Theres no need for `--ask-vault-pass` when running playbooks that consume vault files. There is already an ansible vault password file being set in the config.
